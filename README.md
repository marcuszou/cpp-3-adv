# Ultimate C++ Course 3 - Advanced



## Contents

There are 6 Units in this advanced level C++ course:

- Unit 1 - Using a Moren C++ Compiler (1m)
- Unit 2 - Classes (70m)
- Unit 3 - Operator Overloading (56m)
	- @3.6
- Unit 4 - Inheritance and Polymorphism (50m)
- Unit 5 - Exceptions (23m)
- Unit 6 - Templates (20m)



## Codebase

I have typed in all of the codes as per the videos.

Due to the "int main()" function can only occur once in the project, I have structured the codes for every units:

1. the `main.cpp` is the app you can run, the rest `main#-title-blah-blah.cpp` are for backup, 

2. you can copy the `main#-title-blah-blah.cpp` to `main.cpp`, then run the commands below in the `unit#` folder:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ./main
   ```
